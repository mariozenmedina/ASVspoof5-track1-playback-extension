ASVspoof5.*.tsv are space-separated

ASVspoof5.train.tsv, ASVspoof5.dev.track_1.tsv and ASVspoof5.eval.track_1.tsv have FIVE columns:

   SPEAKER_ID FLAC_FILE_NAME SPEAKER_GENDER CODEC CODEC_Q CODEC_SEED ATTACK_TAG ATTACK_LABEL KEY TMP

   SPEAKER_ID:          T_****, D_****, or E_****        ID of the speaker in the FLAC file
   FLAC_FILE_NAME:      T/D/E_**********                 name of the FLAC file
   SPEAKER_GENDER:      F or M                           gender of the speaker
   CODEC:               C** or -                         name of the codec or compressor condition
   CODEC_Q:             N or -                           codec quality factor configuration number
   CODEC_SEED:          T/D/E_********** or -            if this utterance is coded, name of the original utterance
   ATTACK_TAG:          AC* or -                         tag of the attacker adaptation condition
   ATTACK_LABEL:        A** or bonafide                  name of the attack
   KEY:                 spoof or bonafide                CM key
   TMP:                 -                                reserved column


ASVspoof5.dev.track_2.trial.tsv and ASVspoof5.eval.track_2.trial.tsv have FIVE columns:
    
   TARGET_SPEAKER_ID FLAC_FILE_NAME TARGET_GENDER ATTACK_LABEL ASV_KEY

   TARGET_SPEAKER_ID:   D_****       or E_****           ID of the ASV target speaker

   ASV_KEY:             target, nontarget, or spoof      ASV label



ASVspoof5.dev.enroll.tsv and ASVspoof5.eval.enroll.tsv have TWO columns:

   TARGET_SPEAKER_ID FLAC_FILE_NAMES
   
   TARGET_SPEAKER_ID:   D/E_****                        ID of the ASV target speaker
   FLAC_FILE_NAMES:     D/E_******,D/E_*****,D/E_*****  name of the FLAC files for enrollment

Note
a. FLAC_FILE_NAMES in ASVspoof5.*.enroll.tsv is list of file names separated by ','.
   Some target speakers may have less than 3 enrollment utterances

b. The first column in ASVspoof5.*.track_2.trial.tsv is the ID of the target speaker. 
   The first column in ASVspoof5.*.track_1.tsv and ASVspoof5.train.tsv is the actual speaker ID in the utterance.
   The actual speaker may not be equal to the target speaker when the utterance is used in a 
   non-target AsV trial

c. ASVspoof5.*.track_2.trial.tsv contains limited information on each probe utterance. 
   You may retrieve information (e.g., CODEC) from the corresponding ASVspoof5.*.track_1.tsv

d. for codec quality and the corresponding bit rates, please check ASVspoof5.codec.config.csv

5.Ethics
______________________

ASVspoof 5 is committed to upholding ethical standards and to responsible research practices. Our objective is to enhance the security and reliability of automatic speaker verification (ASV) technology by promoting collaboration and progress in the development of robust spoofing/deepfake detection solutions, to promote participation and to protect the interests of stakeholders.

Data contributors and challenge participants are requested to adhere to local data protection regulations when processing speech data. We ask that you conduct your research and development activities in a responsible manner and be mindful of the potential for the misuse of software solutions and results. You are expected to disclose identified vulnerabilities or weaknesses in ASV technology in a responsible manner. The prompt and appropriate reporting of such findings is the shared responsibility of all in our community, contributes to the improvement of security systems and protects against potential misuse.

The ASVspoof organisers explicitly disassociate themselves from any association with or endorsement of hacking activities, unauthorized access attempts, or the creation of spoofs/deepfakes for malicious purposes or personal gain. We strictly condemn any misuse of the knowledge and tools developed through ASVspoof. Any malicious use of challenge outcomes, results or findings is strictly prohibited.

Please note that the ISCA Code of Ethics, available at https://www.isca-speech.org/iscaweb/index.php/about-isca?id=279, applies to all research publications and reports originating from
the ASVspoof initiative and challenge series.
